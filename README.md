# Front End Developer Guidelines

## Introduction
These developer guidelines attempt to outline fundamental aspects of the FE development process. They aim to ensure the team is consistent in all the work that we produce. We aim to continuously update the guidelines as new practices and technologies develop, this provides us with an excellent opportunity to stay on top of our game.
While some of the rules in this document are personal preference we have agreed on them in over to ensure we’re all on the same wavelength. If you feel something is missing, inaccurate or incorrect then speak up and make yourself heard!

## Catering
### Desktop
By default we develop for current (two previous?) versions of major desktop browsers such Safari, Chrome, Internet Explorer (IE), Firefox and Opera. We also test to ensure IE8 for Windows users get an appropriate, possibly different, experience.
Requests outside of our default specifications need to be discussed and the appropriate timings allocated.

### Mobile
Testing popular small-screen devices is essential in ensuring that a person’s experience of a design is appropriate to the capabilities of the device they’re using. We test our work in:
- iOS: Safari, Google Chrome and Opera Mini
- Android 4.1: Google Chrome, Firefox and Opera Mini 

## Basics
- We use 4 spaces per indentation level. We **never** mix tabs and spaces.
- We keep our content, presentation and behaviour separate.
- We prefer readability over compression, especially with compile tools. 
- We avoid using !important at all times when building from scratch. If you’re having to add that then you need to go back and rework your code. There may be **rare** exceptions when code is out of our control.
