# Front End Developer Guidelines

## JS
JS adds the functionality to our websites, it’s the most dangerous language as far as performance is concerned. Bad JS is - potentially - far worse than bad HTML or CSS.

### JS Basics
- Use of single quotes over double unless needed

#### jQuery
jQuery is a fantastic tool which enables a even playing field across all browsers while making code easier to write. It’s relatively small in size but you should **NOT** be loading the jquery library just to hide a div on click. Consider whether you actually need JS before you implement it into your website.
